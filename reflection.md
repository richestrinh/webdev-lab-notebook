## Reflection Document

### HTML

It felt fine, I've already had experience so it was a refresher for me here. I think the exercise was helpful I don't have much to say since I did not have much trouble.

### CSS
This section was surprising harder since I'm so used to using a library called TailwindCSS so I don't usually touch vanilla CSS.
I had to look up resources on the selectors.

### flexbox
I used online resources like https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to help with this since it helps to visualize the container within containers. I think this was a useful exercise since flexbox is so commonly used.

### css-grid
Similar to the CSS topic, it was harder as well, and to utilize resources outside of class to continue this. I think this exercise was challenging and I don't think I'd typically work on my CSS like this, but I may be biased against in working directly in the CSS files in general.

### bootstrap
I've used bootstrap a few times, so this was a fun memory lane exercise. Not much to say, but I think this exercise personally was more fun compared to the other CSS topics.

### javascript
This section was my favorite since I enjoy using JS. I think the exercises were nice bite-sized directions, and I think it made it enjoyable. I mostly completed this on my own. 

### jquery
I had to resort to external resources to understand this like https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp.

### In General
I feel like I didn't have much to say on each of the exercises specifically. I think my thoughts stem on the overarching topic itself, rather then the specific lessons curated for each topic. Overall I liked the labs, and the pacing was helpful in reinforcing my learnings.
